# Availability: Company register


!!! question "Feedback on draft Global Data Barometer Indicators" You are looking at a draft indicator to be included in the expert survey of the Global Data Barometer. Between now and April 16th we are inviting your feedback on this indicator and the elements it contains. You can provide your feedback by (a) completing this form; or (b) adding in-line annotations. The survey asks the question: To what extent is company information available as structured open data?



=== "Definitions" **Definitions and Identification**

    A national company register should contain details of companies that are incorporated within that country. For the purpose of this indicator, focus on **limited liability companies** or equivalent. 
    
    If there are multiple forms of limited liability company in this country operating under different frameworks, you should **focus your assessment on the most common domestic form**, as identified in the [World Bank's Doing Business report](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies/).
    
    If there are notable variations in the assessment you would make for other common forms of company, please briefly comment on this in the free text justification.

=== "Research Guidance"

    **Starting points**

    - **Sources:**
        - The **[Open Company Data Index](http://registries.opencorporates.com/)** contains assessments for most countries in the world, and provides links to company register web pages in the small print at the bottom of country pages. Some assessments were carried out as early as 2012, so you will need to check the current state of data availability carefully with a primary review of the register.
        - The [World Bank's Doing Business report](https://www.doingbusiness.org/en/data/exploreeconomies/) provides details of the relevant registrar in each country.
    - **Search:**
        - The company register page for details of data downloads or APIs.

    - **Consult:**
        - Third-parties who appear to be using bulk data from the company register to ask whether they access this from an open data source, or via some other route.

    **National and sub-national considerations**

    In some countries company registration is a **sub-national responsibility,** carried out by individual states, regions or cities.

    To achieve the highest scores on this indicator, it should be possible to easily access data about **all companies** in a country. This might be achieved by:

    - Having a central register of companies;
    - Government providing an aggregation service that brings together data from local registers; or
    - Having standardised or comparable quality data availability from every sub-national register, such that a third-party can easily aggregate data from them.

    To assess countries where company registration is organised sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest examples of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice. If relevant, note in the justification any barriers that might exist preventing third-parties from aggregating data from different sub-national registers.
