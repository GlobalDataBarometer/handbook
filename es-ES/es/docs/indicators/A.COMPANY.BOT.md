# Availability: Beneficial ownership


!!! question "Feedback on draft Global Data Barometer Indicators" You are looking at a draft indicator to be included in the expert survey of the Global Data Barometer. Between now and April 16th we are inviting your feedback on this indicator and the elements it contains. You can provide your feedback by (a) completing this form; or (b) adding in-line annotations. The survey asks the question: To what extent is company beneficial ownership information available as structured open data?



=== "Definitions" **Definitions and Identification**

    A beneficial ownership register should contain details of the **natural persons** who have an **ownership or control stake** in registered companies.
    
    Currently existing registers may apply to all *companies* in a jurisdiction, or only to a small sub-set, such as companies involved in the extractives industry, another regulated sector, or in receipt of public procurement contracts.

=== "Research Guidance"

    **Starting points**

    - **Sources:**
        - The [OpenOwnership map](https://www.openownership.org/map/) links to a number of public registers of beneficial ownership (but is not exhaustive or always entirely up to date)
        - Global Witness reporting on EU Beneficial Ownership registers from March 2020 [includes links to a number of available registers](https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/corruption-and-money-laundering/anonymous-company-owners/5amld-patchy-progress/)
        - The [Stolen Asset Recovery Initiative resource library](https://star.worldbank.org/resources?search=beneficial%20ownership) (search for 'beneficial ownership' and filter by country) contains a series of country guides (developed in 2016/17) aimed at public authorities seeking to access company and beneficial ownership information across borders. These can provide context on the kinds of data collected, and (as of their time of publication) accessible to the public.
    - **Search:**
        - Search the website of the National Company Register or Registrar for mentioned of beneficial ownership or related terms
        - 'Beneficial ownership' + [country]
        - 'Ultimate beneficial owner' + [country]
        - Beneficiary owners + [country]
    - **Consult:**
        - Transparency campaigners

    **What to look for?**

    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:

    - Are the public able to access beneficial ownership information, or is it only provided to certain parties (e.g. law enforcement)?
        - Note: in cases where a register exists but is not public, the best sources of info for this are likely to be Anti-Money Laundering (AML) industry and government announcements about relevant legislative changes.
    - Is the data from the register available? Or only a search interface?
    - Is data available in bulk? Is there an API available?
    - Does the available data cover *all* companies, or only those that registered or updated their records after a certain date?

    **National and sub-national considerations**

    Where company registration is a sub-national responsibility, beneficial ownership registers may also be maintained sub-nationally. In these cases, look for and assess the best case example of data availability, and use the extent sub-question to indicate whether this represents common practice or not.

    In cases where neither national nor sub-national government maintain registers, but data is available for a particular sector (e.g. extractives), carry out your assessment for that sector, and use the extent sub-question to indicate whether this represents common practice or not.
