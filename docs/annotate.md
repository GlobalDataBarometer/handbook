# Providing Feedback Using Annotations

During our consultation phase, we have enabled Hypothes.is on all handbook pages to allow you to share feedback on specific sections. This is similar to commenting using Google Docs, providing comments that are visible to all viewers of the handbook.

If you prefer to provide private feedback, you can do this by email at feedback@globaldatabarometer.org, or using the comment form available on each indicator.



## To Add Annotations

You will need to [register](https://hypothes.is/signup) for and/or [log-in](https://hypothes.is/login) to a Hypothesis account. Registration is straightforward and only requires an email address.


Next, highlight the text you wish to add comments on, and select 'Annotate' from the menu that appears as shown in the figure below:

This will open the annotations sidebar, where you can write your comment.

When complete, choose 'Post to public' and your comment will be available for the Global Data Barometer team to review.
