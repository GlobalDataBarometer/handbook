=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    While most countries have some form of right-to-information (RTI) or freedom-of-information (FOI) framework, in practice not all implementations of these frameworks have lived up to expectations. 
    
    This indicator focuses on the availability of administrative data regarding the performance of a country's RTI/FOI obligations. Such administrative data may be required by law or simply provided by governments as part of good practice.
    
    To assess the performance of an RTI/FOI regime, data should include information on: number of requests submitted; response times for filling requests; denials and reasons for withholding; appeals and their results; and related sanctions or remedies.
    
    In some countries, national reporting on the performance of RTI/FOI practices is accomplished through a unified system, while in others such information is published by individual agencies. If in your country individual agencies report their own RTI performance data, you should **focus your assessment on the most representative example of common domestic practice.** 
    
    If there are notable variations in the assessment you would make for other agencies, please briefly comment on this in the free text justification.
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - For COVID-19 disruptions or changes with regard to access to information, RTI Rating offers a specific [COVID-19 Tracker](https://www.rti-rating.org/covid-19-tracker/).
    
    - **Search:**
        - Reports published by the information agency, media reports, and publications by
        development/donor agencies.
        - National statistical offices or the appropriate governmental agency that houses statistical information.
        - Independent oversight bodies, such as transparency councils, ombuds offices, offices of information services.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Government officials who handle appeals to denials for request of information, in order to obtain a sense of the conditions in which an agency denies (or grants) information.
        - Civil society organization officers with expertise in access-to-information issues.
        - Journalists who report on government transparency or who use RTI/FOI requests as part of their practice.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - **How is the data organized?** Is there a docket or similar mechanism for coordinating disparate types of data all related to the same piece of regulation?
    - **What information does the data provide?** For example, does it include number of requests, response times, exemptions and reasons, appeals and their results?
    - **Is the data available at the level of individual agencies**, or only in aggregate?
    - **Does the data include information on remedies or sanctions** for agencies found to be in violation of ROI/FOI?
    - **Is there evidence of missing data,** assessed first against the related governance framework, if that exists, or in the context of the datasets in front of you?
    - **Is there evidence that the availability of this data was affected by COVID-19?**
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries RTI/FOI frameworks have been established by individual states, regions, or cities, and consequently administrative data about FOI performance may be published at various levels of government.
    
    To assess countries where RTI/FOI frameworks are organized sub-nationally, researchers should analyze the administrative data associated with the strongest examples of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Right-to-information practices are a key part of transparency and accountability initiatives that support members of a public in assessing whether and how consistently public officials use political power for the common good. This right to access the information that public authorities hold is recognized by the special mandates for the UN, OSCE, and OAS and connects directly with SDG 16.10.
     
     When RTI practices function well, they support oversight, reduce information asymmetries, and open a dialogue between members of the public and public officials. However, the quality, comprehensiveness, and attention to performance of these laws vary. Further, in practice, a host of obstacles may impede the RTI that legislation lays out, with regard to the timeliness of response, inappropriate use of exemptions, difficulties in contesting decisions—even lack of appropriate staffing and technical expertise among the relevant record officers can be a critical de facto impediment.
