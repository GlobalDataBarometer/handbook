# Availability: Emission

The survey asks the question: To what extent is emissions information available as open data?

=== "Definitions"
    **Definitions and Identification**
    
    Emissions data reported to the UNFCCC should be easily accessible to actors and audiences within the country, so that a diverse group of climate decision-makers can take action across scales. Emissions datasets should include detailed information on sources of greenhouse gas emissions and use unique identifiers that allow easy assessment across inventories, reduction commitments, and sources.
    
    Among other functions, it should be possible to use emissions datasets to easily and accurately assess the current state of the country's emissions and how it is changing (or not) over time, to identify major sources of greenhouse gases within the country, and to explain how the country's emissions fit within the global context.
    
    This question is designed to align with efforts countries already put into reporting emissions data to the UNFCCC. Consequently, it takes as its starting point the emissions data already reported to the UNFCCC and focuses primarily on whether or not that data is also made open, accessible, and useful to actors within the country. It elaborates on that to include sources of emissions, but the specifics of the national dataset would largely be defined by the country's UNFCCC reporting.
    
    **Note:** The focus here is on making already existent data more useful and more broadly available; data on a national site doesn't have to explicitly state that it is the same data as that reported to the UNFCCC, so long as it includes the same data. 
    
=== "Research Guidance"
    
    **Starting points**
    
    - **Sources:**
        - The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; depending on whether the country falls into the Annex I or non-Annex I category, the data may be reported in a dedicated inventory document, the national communications, a biennial update report, or a separate report. Links to all of these can be found [here](https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/greenhouse-gas-data/information-on-data-sources).
    
    - **Search:**
        - Websites of the ministry of environment, office of climate action, etc. for keywords such as "emissions," "greenhouse gases" or "GHGs," "sinks," "inventory," and the "UN Framework Convention on Climate Change," and similar in appropriate languages.
    
    - **Consult:**
        - Officials in your national or local environmental or climate action office.
        - Officials at civil society organizations dedicated to climate action, environmental protection, or nature conservation.
        - Journalists who report on climate change, vulnerability, or adaptation.
        - Academic researchers who study emissions and climate change in your country.
    
    **What to look for?**
    
    To complete the assessment for this question you will need to access and explore the available data. This may involve running queries on datasets to check the variety of fields included.
    
    Look for evidence that can answer the following questions:
    
    - Is the emissions data reported to the UNFCCC also made open and accessible to actors within the country through national or subnational platforms or portals? Are significant portions of it missing in the national version?
    - Who or what are the significant producers of emissions in the country? What level of granularity is available for emissions sources?
    - How straightforward is it to match emissions data across inventories, reduction commitments, and information about emission sources?
    
    **National and sub-national considerations**
    
    In some countries, emissions data may be generated and published at the sub-national level, ****carried out by individual states, regions, or cities.
    
    Focus on **national government** first, and then assess whether:
    
    - National datasets also include data from sub-national or local government units;
    - Equivalent data exists for a selection of sub-national or local government units, but is not nationally aggregated;
    
    To assess countries where emissions data is organized sub-nationally, researchers should select the strongest example of sub-national practice, and then indicate whether this is an outlier, or an example of widespread practice.

=== "Indicator Justification"


     Emissions, and more specifically, greenhouse gas emissions, are the iconic dataset for understanding climate change, tracking climate action, and defining climate stabilization. The speed at which countries, cities, companies, and other actors reduce greenhouse gas emissions has lock-in effects, and both determines the extent of potential benefits and expands or reduces the time available for other acts of mitigation and adaptation. Consequently, stabilizing emissions has been a key component of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) since 1992, with considerable efforts put into sharing emissions data by the scientific and international communities.
     
     Increasingly, a variety of actors seek to understand emissions’ impacts at a more granular level. However, the greenhouse gas inventories and adaptation data countries share with the UNFCCC via their National Communications often aren't available more locally in user-friendly ways.
