# Overview

The overall structure of the Barometer was developed following a [participatory design workshop](https://globaldatabarometer.org/2020/01/reporting-back-on-our-first-design-workshop/), which identified four core components, a range of potential themes, and a number of cross-cutting issues to be addressed in the structure of the study.
 
Below is a full list of the topics to be covered within the pilot edition for which researchers will be asked to provide primary data. These include core modules, thematic modules, and snapshot modules. These modules serve to structure the survey for presentation to researchers, analysts, and potential users of GDB data. Although modules may vary in scope and size, their influence on the overall Barometer score will be balanced through weights applied during index calculations.
 
 
### Core Modules
 
Governance and capability are core components of the Barometer that have been developed as standalone modules, containing a series of primary indicators designed to provide a country-wide assessment of two of the most critical issue areas related to the development of an effective data ecosystem:

* [Governance](Governance.md)
* [Capabilities](http://handbook.globaldatabarometer.org/themes/Capabilities)

These modules are complemented by additional indicators on governance and capability within the thematic and snapshot modules. The other two core components of the Barometer, availability and use, are assessed primarily through the thematic and snapshot modules.
 
### Thematic Modules
 
The overall selection of thematic modules for this pilot edition of the Barometer has been based on the desire to cover a range of government functions and a range of sustainable development goals, as well as to benefit from the expertise of partners who are contributing to the in-depth thematic modules. Currently, a range of GDB partners are contributing to the development of the following thematic modules:
 
 
*   [Company information](Company%20Information.md)—developed with [Open Ownership](https://www.openownership.org/) 
*   [Land](Land/)—developed with the [Land Portal](https://www.landportal.org/)
*   [Political integrity](Political%20Integrity.md)—developed with [Transparency International](https://www.transparency.org/en) and the [Open Government Partnership](https://www.opengovpartnership.org/)
*   [Public Finance](Public%20Finance.md)—developed with [the Global Initiative on Fiscal Transparency](https://www.fiscaltransparency.org/)
*   [Public procurement](Public%20Procurement.md)—developed with [the Open Contracting Partnership](https://www.open-contracting.org/)
*   [Climate action](Climate%20Action.md)
*   [Health and COVID-19](Health%20&%20COVID-19.md)—developed with input from the [Open Data Charter](https://opendatacharter.net/)
